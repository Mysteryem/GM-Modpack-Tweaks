# GM-Modpack-Tweaks
Tweaks for various mods in the GM Modpack, mostly adding mod items and blocks to the ore dictionary so that AOBD will add recipes for them and so that the Mekanism digital miner can find them usign the ore* ore dictionary filter.

Now featuring entirely replaced UBC ore and stone replacement. Also supports replacement of stairs, buttons, stone walls, silverfish blocks of all main types and mossy cobblestone when WTFCaveBiomes is installed.
